One more night, one more night
One more night, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I've been trying, ooh, so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
And if I stumble, if I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see

[Chorus]
Please give me one more night, give me one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me just one more night, uh, just one more night
Oh, one more night 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2]
I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought maybe you're not alone

[Chorus]
Please give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Please give me one more night, ooh, just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Ooh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Like a river to the sea, I will always be with you
And if you sail away, I will follow you

[Chorus]
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh, one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3]
I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind, you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

They delight in fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels
A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

A kiss may be grand
But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat
Or help you at the automat
Men grow cold
As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't loose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Talk to me Harry Winston
Tell me all about it!
There may come a time
When a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
There may come a time
When a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy
When stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
It's then that those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

I've heard of affairs
That are strictly platonic
But diamonds are a girl's best friend

And I think affairs
That you must keep liaisonic
Are better bets
If little pets get big baguettes

Time rolls on
And youth is gone
And you can't straighten up when you bend

But stiff back
Or stiff knees
You stand straight at Tiffany's

Behold the Lord High Executioner
A personage of noble rank and title —
A dignified and potent officer
Whose functions are particularly vital!
Defer, defer
To the Lord High Executioner!
Defer, defer
To the noble Lord, to the noble Lord
To the Lord High Executioner!
[KO-KO]
Taken from the county jail
By a set of curious chances;
Liberated then on bail
On my own recognizances;
Wafted by a favouring gale
As one sometimes is in trances
To a height that few can scale
Save by long and weary dances;
Surely, never had a male
Under such like circumstances
So adventurous a tale
Which may rank with most romances

[KO-KO & NOBLES]
Taken from the county jail

Give them a sense of pride to make it easier

People need someone to look up to

A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

No one would have believed, in the last years of the nineteenth century, that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds of space. No one could have dreamed that we were being scrutinised as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets. And yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly, and surely, they drew their plans against us...

Instrumental (0:37 - 4:51)

[Narration: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
At midnight, on the 12th of August, a huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth. Across two hundred million miles of void, invisibly hurtling towards us, came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth. As I watched, there was another jet of gas. It was another missile, starting on its way...

Instrumental (5:14 - 5:54)

[Narration: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
And that's how it was for the next ten nights. A flare, spurting out from Mars. Bright green, drawing a green mist behind it; a beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight. Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger. He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote, forbidding planet...
[Chorus: Justin Hayward]
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one...
But still, they come!

[Narration: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
Then came the night the first missile approached Earth. It was thought to be an ordinary falling star, but the next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the Common, and Ogilvy came to examine what lay there. A cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot, and with faint sounds of movement coming from within. Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing, and Ogilvy feared there was a man inside trying to escape. He rushed to the cylinder but the intense heat stopped him before he could burn himself on the metal...

[Chorus: Justin Hayward]
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one...
But still, they come!
Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one...
But still, they come!

Instrumental (7:46 - 8:31)

[Narration: Richard Burton (""The Journalist"")]
It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance.

[Chorus: Justin Hayward]
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said
The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one...
But still, they come!
Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one, he said

Where do I take this pain of mine
I run but it stays right by my side

[Chorus]
So tear me open and pour me out
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

[Verse 1]
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now, it stays

So tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm clean

It stains you so hold me (yeah)
It hates you so hold me (yeah)

So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed

Responding with a roar

It's the way that you don't pay that's okay
Cause you can't earn it - love

[Pre-Chorus]
You know you're chewing bubble gum
You know what that is but you still want some
You just can't get enough of that lovey-dovey stuff

[Post-Chorus]
Looking for the one
But you know you're somewhere else instead
You want to be the song
The song that you hear in your head
Love, love, love

[Outro]
But you take what you can get
'Cause it's all that you can find
Oh you know there's something more
But tonight, tonight, tonight

You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a drive
Go out and see what you can find
[Verse 2]
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal

Do a ton or a ton an' twenty-five
When the sun goes down
You can make it, make it good in a lay-by

[Verse 3]
We're not grey people
We're not dirty, we're not mean
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine

And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door (Yeah)

I guess I made an impression on somebody north of Hester and South of Grand

Yo it's a nice summer day man the weather warm
I don't need my skully hat or my leather on
I will not need my long john pants
And there's not even a chance I'mma have to put a sweater on
I hit the block and I take a deep inhale
The warm breeze catch my shirt like a wind sail
I make a left down Hinsdale
Then I see my nigga Rob, man I thought that he was in jail
He in the front yard puffin' on the blunt hard
I stop a while and talk trash like a junk yard
Then keep it moving like the wings on a hummingbird
The whole day's ahead of me, I ain't trynna come in third
I hit the subway waiting on the platform
I see this old man in Sean John and Phat Farm
He asks me if I like rap and I say, ""Yeah""
He takes the Yankee fitted hat off his grey hair
Then he starts to spit the best verse I ever heard
I'm amazed and I'm hangin' on his every word
He goin' in though the train noise loud around
People on they way to work start to crowd around
We can't believe how this old man spittin' fire
He was a hundred bars in and he didn't tire
He kept going and he wasn't backin' away
I heard somebody say they reckognized him from back in the day
Word?

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
When he finished up his verse, everybody clapped
Except a couple kids, that's cause they probably rapped
Against him, these kids wouldn't have lasted a round
He held his Yankee hat out and he passed it around
I dropped a dollar in then I dropped a dollar more
I said, ""Yo old man your rap skills are kind of raw""
He said I graduated high school in '84
And had a hundred verses back then, maybe more
He said it'd been about thirty years plus
Since he was on a bus goin' around doin' a crazy tour
And then he reached into his grey velour
And pulled out a CD that he had dropped way before
I was born, he was on somebody steps sittin'
Holdin' a pen and pad, looing like he'd just written
A song, I said ""You looked way younger then""
He said ""Yeah, that was a long hot summer then""

Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""
""I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""

So much like a man, I just had to say

""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can
[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I gotta ask a favor, and I'll hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest, let this boy die like a man
Starin' down a bullet, let me make my final stand

In small town down in Georgia
Over 40 years ago
Her maiden name was Musik
'Til she met that Jackson boy
They married young like folks did then
Not a penny to their name
But they believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same

[Verse 2]
And on the land his daddy gave him
A foundation underway
For a love to last forever
Or until their dying days
They built a bond that's strong enough
To stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to
When our lives were in a bind
[Chorus]
And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it
And they made that house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord, there'll never be another place
In this world that I'll call home

[Verse 3]
My mama raised five children
Four girls, and there was me
She found her strength and faith in God
And a love of family
She never had a social life
Home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job
To pay a bill or two

[Verse 4]
My daddy skinned his knuckles
On the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money
But he gave us all he had
He never made the front page
But he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from miles around
To let him look underneath the hood

Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe
I want to know if love is real
Oh, can you show me?

[Saxophone Solo]

Beyond the palace, hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you, Wendy, on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss

(1, 2, 3, 4) The highways jammed with broken heroes
On a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl, I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go, and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us

Born to Run LyricsIn the day, we sweat it out on the streets
Of a runaway American dream
At night, we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on Highway 9
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Yes, girl, we were
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire?
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels

As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the mornin' I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699
[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

[Verse 2]
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar

She's out of my life
Ooh
I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

Ooh, she's out of my hands
She's out of my hands
To think for two years that she was here
And i took it for granted
I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands
So i've learned that love is no possession
And i've learned that love won't wait
Now i've learned love need expression
But i've learned much too late

And she's out of my life
Out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
Oh, when it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

[Verse 2]
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need
[Chorus: Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, Both]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true, we'll make a better day
Just you and me

[Verse 3]
Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
And so we all must lend a helping hand

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day

Oh, there's a choice we're making

Total Eclipse of the Heart Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, ooohhhh
Oh, oh, ooohhhh

[Verse 1]
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
[Pre-Chorus]
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

[Chorus]
And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together

[Post-Chorus]
Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

[Refrain]
Oh, oh, ooohhhh

[Verse 2]
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
(Turn around)
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do

Wake up, Maggie
I think I got somethin' to say to you
It's late September
And I really should be back at school

[Chorus 1]
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts
[Verse 2]
The morning sun, when it's in your face
Really shows your age
But that don't worry me none
In my eyes, you're everything

[Chorus 2]
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

[Verse 3]
All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother, what a lover
You wore me out

[Chorus 3]
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
[Chorus]
Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

TranslationsEspañolFake Plastic Trees Lyrics[Verse 1]
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself

[Chorus]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

[Chorus]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

[Chorus]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

Poverty stricken, leave you with hunger pangs
Spar with an oligarch in the dark, and I docked my fist in his face
'Cause my lineage told me break these chains (CHIEF)
Back when I was rappin’ with the homies, everybody always told me:
""Filipinos ain't got business in the game"" bruh
Then I put like 10k in these hours
Every beat that I devoured had me snipin' everybody in my lane bruh

Hearing inner voices singin' ten thousand sounds (Hoo)
Ten thousand marching every time I step foot to the ground
Its' like I'm moonwalkin' with my ten toes down

I don't drink coffee, I'll take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk

Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

I don't know how to leave you and I don't know how to stay

The man behind these empty words is crying out in shame
Holding on to this sinking ship when nothing else remains

All I want is everything like the feel of your touch
But all I have are yesterdays, tomorrow never comes

It's hard to hold your head up when you're kneeling down to pray
And the talking doesn't come easy now when the words get in the way
And if you could see what's going on behind these private eyes
The truth would look so easy now but I'm running out of lies

Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here

And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away

It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
The loneliness calls

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

[Verse 2]
I've been in love and lost to my senses
Spinnin' through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feelin' down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last

Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you

You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
[Verse 1]
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

[Verse 2]
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

I don’t really have to say much
We'll let the music do the talking
[Verse 1: V9]
From a young G, I ball like a goalie, bro hit the target, no Stoney
Do man up for my broski, I'm in the back of the dings for my cody
5 man like Kids Next Door, running yutes down but my stamina's poor
It's just slip or God will know if my man tripped, you know how it goes
Sword come long like Yao Ming, flick shanks slide up like Stanley's
I do up a opp boy badly, me and Sheggz got him down on a mad ting
I can't move too loose, I'm on the road, got too much to lose
Spill that juice, revenge, my fucking Bruce
And how many man over there been chinged, but still woke up from death?
This shit’s ments’, the life I live there's no sense
I won’t stop till half of them dead
But it's easier, said than done, cah the man there good with their legs
Come like my opps are Ade, cah the man there don't know 'bout stand off’s
Man get banged on, headtop red like a tampon
I'm old school like Master Splinter ,my heart come colder than winter
9ers known for the ringers, samurai eat man for dinner
Samurai eat man for dinner

[Verse 2: V9]
Pull up on smoke, so of course I'm stepping on violence
Fuck Trident, hop out the car and knife man
The life I live is intense, back road with a fuck-off skeng
I'll firm that dots like Krillin, I just pray the kickback ain't ments'
I'm fucking tapped, roll with a Sammy like Samurai Jack
Get w*cked, get wacked for giving man chat
Ask my man, he got licked with a bat
Main road still doing up mazza
Fuck cameras, I ain't got no manners
See a opp, I set it straight, no lay-lay, get bored in the face
Dem man run off and leave their friends
How many man split up and do legs?
Fucking gems, this shit ain't making no sense
They shooting pellets, they don't need the petty
Get round there, leave the whole scene messy
How many times they look in man's eyes and still run away like it's Sharingan?
Get a dent in your chest, just like All Might opp block, man suck it all god damn night
Gang pull on tookie and slap man's spine, V9 with the raw, you ain't safe outside
Young boy said he wants to make P's, I told him ""Bring them cards like Yugi""
Bro doing up O, that's Cleveland Brown and Julie
Anything Woolly get splashed and chinged
The olders run before seeing a thing, are you fucking kidding?
Of course you get chinged for being in vids
Put my foot on the curb one by one, same way I put bells on the dots
Catch a opp, he's gone, slap shots tryna turn man off
MC Hammer, can't touch this, This burning wap, it's disgusting
Up it and bang it in public, head back, won't heal it if I bruck it
Don't take the piss, I'm taking trips, gut man like fish
Long arse Sammy, wet man down on the mains, he's pissed
Spill juice like Cognac, this wap come blacker than Kodak
Trapline what? You don't want that, take man's line, yeah I'm on that
And this flick come small like Stanley, take it out and I get real splashy
Take it out and I get real—

He's been a long, long while in Babylon
He'd like a lover's wings to fly on
To a tropic isle of Avalon

He's got a force field and a flexible plan
He's got a date with fate in a black sedan
He plays fast-forward just as long as he can
But he won't need a bed
He's a digital man

Good morning, Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show the prisoner
Who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed, showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!
[Verse 2: The Schoolmaster]
I always said he'd come to no good in the end, your honour
If they'd let me have my way, I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today

[Chorus: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, toys in the attic, I am crazy
Truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away!
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)
[Verse 3: Wife]
You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone

The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate

Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear

Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights, huh, and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gangway
You better hit the bullseye, the kid don't play
And if there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it

Quick to the point, to the point, no fakin'
Cookin' MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' 'em if you're not quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With the ragtop down so my hair can blow

Kept on, pursuin' to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm headin' to the next stop
The block was dead, yo, so I continued to
A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous, 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a 9
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots raged out like a bell
I grabbed my 9, all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack

Along the drifting cloud, the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land

Go closer, hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too
Twenty-four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you
[Middle-Eight]
Along the drifting cloud, the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand
Go closer, hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time, a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears, we stand surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout, the words will make you out-and-out
I'll be the roundabout, the words will make you out-and-out

Take me to that place that I call home
Take away the strains of being lonely
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road

The sun went down and the night fills the sky

In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding 'round
Like a child, but pardon me

'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the childhood

Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

We're not scared to lose it all, security thrown through the wall
Future dreams we have to realise
A thousand sceptic hands won't keep us from the things we plan
Unless we're clinging to the things we prize

[Chorus]
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better
[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh, whoa-whoa, whoa-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Treating today as though it was the last, the final show
Get to 60 and feel no regret
It may take a little time, a lonely path, an uphill climb
Success or failure will not alter it

[Chorus]
And do you feel scared? I do
But I won't stop and falter
And if we threw it all away
Things can only get better

Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Oohoohooh oooh

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Unlucky in love, least that's what they say
He lost his head and he gambled his heart away
He still keeps searching though there's nothing left
Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

""It's okay"", he smiles and says
Though this loneliness is driving him crazy
He don't show what goes on in his head
But if you watch very close you'll see it all

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody
Someday somebody's gonna see inside

I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
[Verse 2]
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon

She bangs, she bangs
Oh baby when she moves, she moves
I go crazy 'cause she looks like a flower
But she stings like a bee
Like every girl in history
She bangs, she bangs
I'm wasted by the way she moves
No one ever looked so fine
She reminds me that a woman's
Got one thing on her mind

Man, if Lady Luck gets on my side
We're gonna rock this town alive
I'll let her rough me up
'Till she knocks me out

I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

[Verse 2]
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling
[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you, oh
Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human
Have thoughts like any other one
Sometimes I find myself long regretting
Some foolish thing some little simple thing I've done

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1]
Grim faced and forbidding, their faces closed tight
An angular mass of New Yorkers
Pacing in rhythm, race the oncoming night
They chase through the streets of Manhattan
Head first humanity, pause at a light
Then flow through the streets of the city

They seem oblivious to a soft spring rain
Like an English rain
So light, yet endless
From a leaden sky
The buildings are lost in their limitless rise
My feet catch the pulse and the purposeful stride

[Chorus]
I feel the sense of possibilities
I feel the wrench of hard realities
The focus is sharp in the city

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Wide angle watcher on life's ancient tales
Steeped in the history of London
Green and grey washes in a wispy white veil
Mist in the streets of Westminster
Wistful and weathered, the pride still prevails
Alive in the streets of the city

Are they oblivious to this quality?
A quality
Of light unique to
Every city's streets

I don't wanna dissect everything today
I don't mean to pick you apart, you see
But I can't help it

Slap me with the splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella
I like to reel it in and then spit it out
I'm frustrated by your apathy

And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land
If only I could meet the maker
And I am fascinated by the spiritual man
I'm humbled by his humble nature, yeah

Stop the world (vogliamo tornare a giocare) LyricsGuarda nei tuoi occhi
Adesso dimmi cosa vedi
Un cuore che oramai
Non ti appartiene più
Non c'è posto in questa terra
Per le tue ali stanche
E insegui I tuoi pensieri a testa in giù

Please, stop the world now
You stop the world, stop the world
Please, stop the world now
You stop the world, stop the world
Guardami negli occhi
Sai dirmi cosa resta
Di una vita senza sogni
E senza amore?
E al di là dei vetri
Puoi trovare una risposta
Fermiamo questo mondo adesso

Please, stop the world now
You stop the world, stop the world
Please, stop the world now

You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing
And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2]
So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
Tell myself you never loved me, no
And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't wanna know
Oh no
And can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't wanna know

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me
I follow you down
'Til the sound of my voice will haunt you
(Oh, give me just a chance)
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
(Was I just a fool?)

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

'Cause she needs somebody

Really, really ever loved a woman?

To really love a woman - Let her hold you

[Verse 1]
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay
[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

[Verse 2]
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

[Chorus]
The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

Focus Hocus Pocus (One Night Stand) LyricsOh, me and my old friend, guitar
We're stuck inside a worn out car
We never thought we'd get this far
Me and my friend, guitar

My voice is gone, my throat is sore
My head aches and my eyes are raw
I think I'll sleep a week or more
I got headaches and my throat is sore

Oh, woman, this life is grand
Travellin' to a one night stand
I am a-singin' with a rockin' band
Oh, woman this life is grand
They listened when we sang our song
They joined us and they sang along
And they rarely ever did us wrong
'Cause they listened when we played our song

Now, I know there's always time to learn
To let your better feelings burn
To let your heart have its turn
And I know there's always time to learn

Whoa, oh, oh, woman, this life is grand
Travellin' to a one night stand
I'm a-singin' with a rockin' band
Oh, oh, woman, this life is grand, now

Whoa, oh, oh, woman, this life is grand
Travellin' to a one night stand
I'm a-singin' with a rockin' band
Oh, oh, woman, this life is grand

Now, Graham likes to sit and jam
He's playin' with the guitar man
Well, he's learnin' all the bits he can
Now, Graham likes to sit and jam

He's been drinkin' that Dutch beer down
It helps to keep him on the ground
'Cause he really can't believe the sound
So he's drinkin' that Dutch beer down

I couldn't get my eyes to Focus right
The sun came and he woke us tight
'Cause we had a Hocus Pocus night

Now, we're on a road that never ends
Cul-de-sacs, double bends
But I think we made a few more friends
On the road that never ends

Whoa, whoa, whoa, woman, this life is grand

Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light

[Verse 1]
Kinda like a cloud, I was up, way up in the sky
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe
Sometimes I don't believe them myself
And I decided I was never coming down
Just then, a tiny little dot caught my eye
It was just about too small to see
But I watched it way too long
It was pulling me down
[Chorus]
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it

[Verse 2]
Shut up! So what? What does it matter now?
I was swimming in the haze, now I crawl on the ground
And everything I never liked about you
Is kind of seeping into me
Try to laugh about it now
But isn't it funny how everything works out?
""I guess the joke's on me,"" she said

I wanna be a pilot
And fly over the sea
I wanna start a riot
And kill my enemies

I wanna fight for justice
In one way or another
I want more liberation
To do just what I wanna
[Hook: ODiN]
Don't wanna need the money
Don't wanna need the drugs
But then again I wanna be like Gucci bussin jugs

I wanna pop 'em bands
And make the strippers dance
But at the same time I wanna be a family man

[Verse 1: ODiN]
And that's a mother fucking fact, I don't make shit up
If you think you can relate, let me know wassup
When you see me in the streets come and show me love
If you wanna buy some beats I got plenty bruh

This a life I've chosen
Not the most convenient
Living on the bread line all I do is dreaming

Mamas and the papas
California dreaming
Monday, Monday, everyday like Sunday, always scheming

I could've been a pilot
Could've been a doctor
Could've been a coke boy or a coked up lawyer
You might also likeCould give up my dreams
Live an average life
But I'm ambitious and my vision ain't a trophy wife

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ODiN]
I wanna be a hero
I wanna set examples
I wanna be De Niro
And shoot holes in they temples

Wanna go back in time
And meet some dead people
Wanna be colour blind
Say everybody equal

But I feel hate too
Maybe I hate you
Maybe I don't though
I guess you'll never know

I keep some shit to myself
Some things just don't concern you
And if you don't understand then bitch you better learn to
Take 'em to school or church
These days whatever works
These days it barely hurts
To keep it down to earth

Well I wonder which set of rooms are mine

You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

Her absent-minded eyes
And she has kept me wondering for so long
How this thing could go wrong

It seems to me that we are both the same
Playing the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart

She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable, and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable
Days like these no one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There's nothing words can say

She's colored all the secrets of my soul
I've whispered all my dreams
But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart, yeah

She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt someone I love

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

As the smile ran away from his face

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies

There you are, wild and free
Reaching out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am holding you all through the night

Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light (I'll be the light)
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one

And make sure that you'll be alright

And fate won't resist some satin sheets

I'm on a mission, I've made my decision
Lead a path of self-destruction
A slow progression, killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth

[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face
[Verse 2]
Every hour, my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thin, white line

[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face, say!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a mission, I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
A wish in one hand, shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first

[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well I don't know what I want, and that's all that I've got

I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing, but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around?
And I get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

[Pre-Chorus]
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again?
[Chorus]
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker?
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

[Verse 2]
My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me

[Pre-Chorus]
Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you, love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye?

And they whispered into your brain

And they made you change your name

When the rain set in
And I would've liked to know you

The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Video Killed the Radio Star LyricsI heard you on my wireless back in '52
Lying awake intent on tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
Oh oh
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the supernova scene
Oh oh
I met your children
Oh oh
What did you tell them
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind we've gone too far

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
You hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go
Oh oh
You were the first one
Oh oh
You were the last one

We can't rewind we've gone too far

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

[Verse 2]
And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

[Verse 3]
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic

[Chorus]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth

To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way

While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

[Bridge]
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high

Wind Beneath My Wings Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

[Verse 2]
So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain
[Chorus]
Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

[Verse 2]
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

[Chorus 2]
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

[Bridge]
Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

I can't be no-one else
I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic
You can have it all, but how much do you want it?
You make me laugh
Give me your autograph
Can I ride with you in your BMW?
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You need to find out
'Cause no-one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
You need to find a way for what you want to say
But before tomorrow

'Cause my friend said he'd take you home
He sits in a corner all alone
He lives under a waterfall
Nobody can see him
Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

[Verse 2]
You need to be yourself
You can't be no-one else
I know a girl called Elsa, she's into Alka-Seltzer
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big Issue

But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
Because I can tell what's going on

Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west
Where real women come equipped with scripts and fake breasts
Find a nest in the Hills, chill like Flynt
Buy an old drop-top find a spot to pimp
And I'ma Kid Rock it up and down ya' block
With a bottle of scotch and watch lots a crotch
Buy a yacht with a flag sayin' ""Chillin' the Most""
Then rock that bitch up and down the coast
Give a toast to the sun, drink with the stars
Get thrown in the mix and tossed outta bars
Sip the Tiajuana, I want to roam
Find Motown, tell them fools to come back home
Start an escort service for all the right reasons
And set up shop at the top of Four Seasons
Kid Rock and I'm the real McCoy
And I'm headed out west sucker because I wanna be a

I can smell a pig from a mile away

[Verse 2]
I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin' when my train rolls in
It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind
Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind
I once was lost but now I'm just blind
Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice
Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss
And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy
And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me

No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right

[Verse 1]
If you see something that looks like a star
And it's shooting up out of the ground
And your head is spinning from a loud guitar
And you just can't escape from the sound
Don't worry too much, it'll happen to you
We were children once, playing with toys

[Pre-Chorus]
And the thing that you're hearing is only the sound of
The low spark of high-heeled boys
[Chorus]
The percentage you're paying is too high priced
While you're living beyond all your means
And the man in the suit has just bought a new car
From the profit he's made on your dreams
But today you just read that the man was shot dead
By a gun that didn't make any noise
But it wasn't the bullet that laid him to rest
Was the low spark of high-heeled boys

[Instrumental Break 03:02-03:50]
[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2]
If you had just a minute to breathe
And they granted you one final wish
Would you ask for something like another chance?
Or something similar as this?
Don't worry too much it'll happen to you
As sure as your sorrows are joys

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And the thing that disturbs you is only the sound of
The low spark of high-heeled boys

Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)
*Shot* (Yahoo!)
[Verse 2]
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

[Verse 3]
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

The boy child is locked in the fisherman's yard
There's a bloodless moon where the ocean died
A shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets
And the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie
Where is the fisherman, where is the goat?
Where is the keeper in his carrion coat?
Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies
Where is the child with his father's eyes?

[Chorus]
There are the soul cages
These are the soul cages
[Verse 2]
He's the king of the ninth world
The twisted son of the fog bells toll
In each and every lobster cage
A tortured human soul
These are the souls of broken factories
The subject slaves of the broken crown
The dead accounting of old guilty promises
These are the souls of the broken town

[Chorus]
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages
These are the soul cages

[Verse 3]
'I have a wager' the brave child spoke
The fisherman laughed, though disturbed at the joke
'You will drink what I drink but you must equal me
And if the drink leaves me standing, a soul shall go free'
'I have here a cask of most magical wine
A vintage that blessed every ship in the line
It's wrung from the blood of the sailor's who died
Young white bodies adrift in the tide'
'And what's in it for me, my pretty young thing?
Why should I whistle, when the caged bird sings?
If you lose a wager with the king of the sea
You'll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me

I Swear Lyrics[Intro]
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

[Verse 1]
I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
'Cause I stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
[Chorus]
And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there
For better or worse, 'til death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear

[Verse 2]
I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls
And when (And when) just the two of us are there
You won't have to ask if I still care
'Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all

[Chorus]
And I swear (I swear) by the moon
And the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there)
I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there (I'll be there)
For better or worse, 'til death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I swear

Long ago in days untold
Were ruled by Lords of greed
Maidens fared with gold
They dared to bare their wombs that bleed

Kings and queens and guillotines
Taking lives denied
Starch and parchment laid the laws
When bishops took the ride
Only to deceive
Oh I know I lived this life afore
Somehow know now truths I must be sure
Tossing turning nightmares burning dreams of swords in hand
Sailing ships the Viking spits the blood of father's land
Only to deceive

Living times of knights and mares
Raising swords for maidens fair
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride

Living other centuries
Deja vu or what you please
Follows true to all who do or die

Screams of no reply they died
Screams of no reply and died
Lordy lordy and then then they died
Lordy no then they died

Baby, do you understand me now
Sometimes I feel a little mad
But don't you know that no one alive
Can always be an angel
When things go wrong I seem to be bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

And sometimes it seems that all I have do is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy I want you to know
That I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get my share
And that's one thing I never meant to do
Because I love you, oh
Oh, oh baby don't you know I'm human

So useless to ask me why

And die behind the wheel

As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

You'll find that it's stranger than known

Are somewhere just being their own

Nowhere is there warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain gray town, known for its sound
In places, small faces unbound

Round the squares, huddled in storms

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 1]
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last
[Chorus]
Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 2]
When I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me, darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
[Verse 2]
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

Fleas and ticks jump everywhere
Cause of original sin
Down the hill fell Jack and Jill
And you came tumbling after
Cause of original sin

Drink a hope to happy years
And you may find
A lifetime's passed you by

Don't cut my lifeline
If you a doggie on a chain
Don't bite the mailman

Ate his head, thought it was a candy
Everyone goes in the end
Knock, knock on the door
Who's it for? There's nobody in here
Look in the mirror, my friend

Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase

But he thinks he'd blow our minds

'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two

Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

Play That Funky Music Lyrics[Intro]
A-hey, do it now, huh
Yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer
Playing in a rock and roll band
I never had no problems, yeah
Burning down the one-night stands
Then everything around me, yeah
It got to start to feeling so low
And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh
To disco down and check out the show
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me
Somebody turned around and shouted

""Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music right

Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die"", heh heh
'Til you die, yeah (What?)
Hear, hear, heh

[Verse 2]
A-heh, I tried to understand this (Yeah)
Heh, I thought that they were out of their minds
Heh, how could I be so foolish, how could I
To not see I was the one behind?
So still I kept on fighting
Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?)
I said, ""I must go back there"", I got to go back
And check to see if things still the same

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, they were dancing and singing
And moving to the grooving
And just when it hit me

[Verse 1: Bas]
Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though, she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe, Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend, damn they was close
Let's reunite, let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row, hit a flight, and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager, ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary, Fiend

Might never have another, so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets, damn I ain't got a rubber

Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Room 508, check by the safe, she say ""Boy you got it made
Do you got a cape?"", I ain't with the games ma, do I gotta wait?

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin

Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz, well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce, that can't get enough

Man hang that nigga, you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole, um world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me, long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Woah, that's TMI, lil' something like TMZ
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
Cause my girl do not play, coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out

Writin' rhymes out, momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'

Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
""Hey, boy, do you wanna score?""
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

[Verse 2]
I didn't notice, but it had got very dark, and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
Asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line?
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh
[Verse 3]
Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah! Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)

[Verse 4]
If you go down in the streets
Today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes, woah yeah
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains

Over the hills where the spirits fly

Wondering what I have could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening

All this time, I still remember everything you said, ah-ha

Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep

Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving

And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales

Still untouched by men
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by

And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

They're beating plowshares into swords

Oh, who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby, give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 1]
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""
[Refrain]
La, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

[Chorus]
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

[Verse 2]
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""
[Refrain]
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da
La-la, di-dee-da, da-dum

[Verse 3]
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

So let me hide the tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

Walk on by (don't stop)

You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chicks
I'd been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said ""What you need is Love Potion Number Nine""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said ""I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India Ink

This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide!

[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog

Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch

Diamond Dogs Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
This ain't rock 'n' roll, this is genocide!

[Verse 1]
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 2]
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

[Verse 3]
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[Chorus]
(Will they come?) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?) Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?) Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog

That rode us all the way in to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin', honey, if it ain't free, no no
Yeah, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done

Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
[Verse 2]
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best
I wonder if she'll ever do the same
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied
With knowin' I got no one left to blame

[Chorus]
Carefree highway, I got to see you my old flame
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you

[Verse 3]
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep
I wonder if the years have closed her mind
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew

[Chorus]
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you
Carefree highway, you seen better days
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes
Carefree highway, let me slip away
Slip away on you
Let me slip away on you

Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me

He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe

To a place I hoped it would never go

I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive

Drowning in my autocratic ways

She doesn’t know her name
She doesn’t know her face

[Verse 1]
Lady picture show, she hides behind the bedroom door
Lady picture show she hides behind the bedroom wall
She hides because she don’t know nothing, don’t know nothing anymore
She keeps a funny face it’s locked and bagged it’s just outside the door

High green chilly winds and windy vines
In loops around the twining shafts of lavender
They're crawling to the sun
Wonder who will water all the children of the garden
When they sigh about the barren lack of rain and
Droop so hungry 'neath the sky, Ai-yi
Underfoot the ground is patched
With climbing arms of ivy wrapped around the manzanita
Stark and shiny in the breeze
William tell has stretched his bow
'Til it won't stretch no furthermore
And/or it may require a change that hasn't come before
No more time to tell how, this is the season of what
Now is the time of returning with our thought
Jewels polished and gleaming
Now is the time past believing the child has relinquished the rein
Now is the test of the boomerang tossed in the night of redeeming
Seven faced marble eyed transitory dream doll
Six proud walkers on the jingle bell rainbow
Five men writing with fingers of gold
Four men tracking down the great white sperm whale
Three girls waiting in a foreign dominion
Riding in the whalebelly, fade away in moonlight
Sink beneath the waters to the coral sands belowYou might also like1Embed","Grateful_Dead

Hello everyone
I suppose you think that nothing much is happening at the moment
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Well, that's what I want to talk to you all about; endings
Now, endings normally happen at the end
But as we all know, endings are just beginnings
You know, once these things really get started, it's jolly hard to stop them again
However, as we have all come this far, I think
Under the circumstances the best solution is that we all just keep going
Let's keep this going in sight, never an ending
Let's remember that this world wants fresh beginnings
I feel here, in this country, and throughout the world
We are crying out for beginnings, beginnings
We never want to hear this word ""endings""
I know we all want to sit down
I know you want to take it easy
Of course we're looking for the good
Of course we're looking for the fresh start
Isn't that charming?
Do you know, I really feel I could dance

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?
[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

[Verse 2]
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistakin'
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me

[Pre-Chorus]
How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

[Chorus]
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

Different degrees...

[Verse 1]
So much style without substance
So much stuff without style
It's hard to recognize the real thing
It comes along once in a while
Like a rare and precious metal beneath a ton of rock
It takes some time and trouble to separate from the stock
You sometimes have to listen to a lot of useless talk
Shapes and forms against the norm
[Chorus]
Against the run of the mill
Swimming against the stream
Life in two dimensions is a mass production scheme

[Verse 2]
So much poison in power, the principles get left out
So much mind on the matter, the spirit gets forgotten about
Like a righteous inspiration overlooked in haste
Like a teardrop in the ocean, a diamond in the waste
Some world-views are spacious
And some are merely spaced

[Chorus]
Against the run of the mill
Static as it seems
We break the surface tension with our wild kinetic dreams

Curves and lines
Of grand designs

[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous, so when I diss, you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I'll strangle you to death, then I'll choke you again
And break your fuckin' legs 'til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les'
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
[Chorus]
Now, follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat shrooms, then OD
Now, don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco

I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt

That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)

Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

I Have Nothing Lyrics[Verse 1]
Share my life, take me for what I am
'Cause I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream

And now I realize
It's all a game you play
I hold you in the night
And wake to find you gone
You're running out of sight
It's so hard holding on
All alone in love
[Chorus]
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone, you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love

[Verse 2]
You haunt me in my dreams
I'm calling out your name
I watch you fade away
Your love is not the same
I figured out your style
To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love

[Bridge]
Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it
Through the night
Slowly fall apart without you
Cry away the hours
'Till the morning light

Listen boy I don't want to see you let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made

[Bridge 1]
She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

[Verse 2]
Oh, listen boy I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept that you're for real
Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her, let her know how much she means

[Verse 3]
Listen boy it's not automatically a certain guarantee
To ensure yourself you've got to provide communication constantly

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you love someone, you're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

[Chorus 2]
Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it, every day before you leave
Pay her some attention, give her something to believe

[Bridge 2]
Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
And though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone?

I'd feel like a fool
Life can be so cruel

What though the tempest loudly roars?
I hear the truth, it liveth
What though the darkness 'round me grows?
Songs in the night it giveth

[Verse 4]
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?

How Can I Keep From Singing? Lyrics[Verse 1]
My life goes on in endless song
Above earth's lamentations
I hear the real, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation

[Verse 2]
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear it's music ringing
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?
[Verse 3]
What though the tempest loudly roars?
I hear the truth, it liveth
What though the darkness 'round me grows?
Songs in the night it giveth

[Verse 4]
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging
Since love is lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

[Verse 5]
When tyrants tremble in their fear
And hear their death knell ringing
When friends rejoice both far and near
How can I keep from singing?

Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing
Or maybe we just stopped trying

[Chorus]
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died
And I can't hide and I just can't fake it
Oh no no no no (no no, no no)

It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool

Though we really did try to make it (We can't make it)

Joyride Lyrics[Spoken Intro]
C'mon, join the joyride, everybody
Get your tickets here
Step right this way

[Chorus]
Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride

[Verse 1]
I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need a book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

[Verse 2]
She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon

She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

[Chorus]
She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride.""
Join the joyride

[Verse 3]
She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run

Hey when they see ya boy, what's they first impression?
Probably not a teen redeemed from the worst transgressions
That's repented from the path of His first ancestors
Was cursed but since rebirth this person's dressed in
The glorious righteousness of Christ
They probably think I'm on the stage cause I like the mic
Or like to get hype, but really I'm laid back main
But sometimes could lose my mind if you say that name
(Who?) Jehohah Jireh, my soul's provider
Life without Him's a contradiction like bein' poor with Prada
I done wrote a lot of flows, in my soul's a fire
That shut up in my bones, ah my soul desire
Is for some slick guys to the know the Lord He died
But still the Son did rise like it was mornin' time
So if you think you fully satisfied with a vette with chrome
You better check yourself like playin' chess alone
I'm a stranger, is Earth really my residence? Nope
I'm a alien and I can't wait to rest at home
My dress ain't always fresh to def I ain't impressed with clothes
But Christ, He's the key to life dog and death's the door (and rebirth)
Since the moment I believed, my flesh was broke
Sin lost it's control and death it's hold
So maybe now you'll understand and get up in ya brain
Why ya boy so young and unashamed
[Verse 2:]
They don't associate ya boy with Christ Jesus kid
Cause I got my hat cocked and my jeans is big
No suit and tie, tall tees and kicks
But you ain't gotta be a geek to preach that Jesus lives
So it's almost strange when they see me hit tha street blocks
Cause with my life I copy Christ like a Xerox
No heat cocked, I roll with the Lord and
With a team full of Saints like I play for New Orleans
We hold each other accountable when seekin sound doctrine
Through Christ we been found not guilty without Cochran
We kingdom people selected to rep His name
Forget bout cheddar main, Christ is the better thing
I don't let no weapon hang, I don't roll with thugs
That's holdin drugs and spendin all they dough in clubs
I roll with a gang of believers that's crazy for Jesus
That's saved from the flames and unashamed of His teachings
Cats be like, ""You just a baby, how you know about the Lord?""
To know Jehovah at His core we had to open up our swords
We read His word on a daily, His inspired text
And submit to the Spirit dog, we died to flesh
I confess, they tell us that our youth is bein wasted
Instead of jewels up in a bracelet, we speak truth each time we make hits
So maybe now it's stuck up in ya brain
Why the 116 is so young and unashamed

Cats don't really understand, they think I lost my mind

I was livin' for today, was always caught in crimes
Bout guilty as O.J., my talk and walk declined
The Boss of time and space, but I put that to rest man
I saw my old life, it wasn't right like my left hand
Now He orders my steps and with Him is how I walk bro
Got off the highway to Hell and I took the cross roads
Now I'm walkin with Christ, what beautiful thing
It's cooler than fame, more precious than jewelry and chains
Most think God is just old school like Kool and the Gang
They wanna be like Jeezy, Jay-Z and Ludacris main
But I'm here today to say that if you want a greater day
Don't fade away, cling to Christ and His amazing savin grace
If you a Christian who accepted the King and you clean

That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said, son

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Papa was a rolling stone, (my son, yeah)
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone
Hey Momma!
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life
And Momma, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that
Papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
Heard some talk Papa doing some store front preachin'
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Momma just hung her head and said
Papa was a rolling stone, (my son)

Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills
Hey Momma
Folks say Papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

Genie in a Bottle Lyrics[Intro]
(Come on, come on, uh, yeah)
Oh-ooh, whoa-oh (Come on, come on, uh)

[Verse 1]
I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips and blowin' kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (Baby, baby, baby)

[Verse 2]
The music's bangin' and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racin' at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight (Yeah)

When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
Do you tell lies? And say that it's forever
Do you think twice, or just touch and see?
Ooh, babe
Oh, yeah
When you're alone, do you let go?
Are you wild and willing or is it just for show?
Ooh, come on

'Cause making love to you might drive me crazy
I know you think that love is the way you make it
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it

It's bringing me to my knees
Love lives, love dies

Am I getting through or do you please yourself?

If you really wanna dance, then clap your hands!

You heard of the Moon Walk? Well this is the Earth Walk. It goes like this:

Put your right foot forward
Put your left foot forward
Put your right foot forward
Put your left foot forward
See? It looks just like you're walking on the Earth!

Right, left, turn around!
Right foot, lеft foot
Right, left, turn around!

Now scream! (aaah!)
Everybody scream! (aaah!)

Household use only. Caution, do not immerse in water
Warning, to prevent electrical shock unplug before cleaning
That was a shout-out to all the toaster-owners in the house

The next part of the dance is called the Happy Cow
First you gotta hunch over and make your fingers into horns. And then you do this:

Tip to the left
Say ""MOO!"" (Moo!)
Tip to the right
Say ""I'm a happy cow!"" (I'm a happy cow!)

Simultaneously, in particular we hear ""Do You Believe In Life After Love""]

Remember, I am the originator of the Dada Slide
If anybody tells you different, fart in their face
And have their name legally changed to
""Gladys The Barbarian""

Now this is the tricky part of the dance
We call it the Virtual Hambone. Pay really close attention. Here we go:

Both hands out front
Spread your fingers like that
Pretend you're at a keyboard
Go 'Clacky clack clack'! (Clacky clack clack!)
Then clap your hands, [clap]

Then another clap! [clap]

Oh wait, they're in my pocket. Nevermind

Now this is the part of the dance called the Hyperactive Flamingo
You heard me right, Hyperactive Flamingo. It's real simple

Right hand in the air
Now make a beak
Put your left hand back
Grab one of your feet

Now hop one time! [1 musical sting]
Now hop two times! [2 musical stings]
Now hop three times! [3 musical stings]
Now hop twenty-seven times! [27 musical stings]

…Keep going… …Almost there!...

Scream! (aaah!)
Let me hear you scream! (aaah!)

Everybody vote Republican!
[For 4 measures, we hear four different fuddy-duddy
Murmuring voices saying why people should vote for
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, etc.,
Simultaneously.]

Okay, now's the time when we take everything you learned
And bring it all together. Do the Dada Slide! Are you ready? Here we go!

[At this point we hear TV's Kyle, Insane Ian, Soggy Potato Chips
And Odd Austin begging to be released from the crazy person
Who has them held captive in a pit in the basement of his house
This lasts through the rest of the song.]

Scream all you want! There isn't a person around for miles
Ain't nobody gonna hear you. Now, it puts the lotion
On it's skin or else it gets the hose again!

Puts the lotion on it's skin
Gets the hose again

Now this is the tricky part of the dance
We call it the Virtual Hambone. Pay really close attention. Here we go:

Both hands out front
Spread your fingers like that
Pretend you're at a keyboard
Go 'Clacky clack clack'! (Clacky clack clack!)
Then clap your hands, [clap]
Quick left knee slap, [slap]
Quick right knee slap, [slap]
Then another clap! [clap]
Then you put it all together, double time, and it goes like this:
Clacky clack clack!
Clap-a-slap-slap! [Clap-a-slap-clap]
Clacky clack clack!
Clap-a-slap-slap! You! [Clap-a-slap-clap]
(Clacky clack clack!) [Clap-a-slap-clap]
(Clacky clack clack!) [Clap-a-slap-clap]

Happy Cow!
Tip to the left, (Moo!)
Tip to the right, (I'm a happy cow!)
Tip to the left, (Moo!)
Tip to the right, (I'm a happy cow!)

Earth Walk!
Right foot, left foot
Right, left, turn around!
Right foot, left foot
Right, left, turn!

Everybody scream! (aaah!)
One more time! Scream! (aaah!)

Hey, has anybody seen my car keys?
It's got a key chain of My Little Pony on it
Oh wait, they're in my pocket. Nevermind
Okay, here we go y'all

Now this is the part of the dance called the Hyperactive Flamingo
You heard me right, Hyperactive Flamingo. It's real simple

Right hand in the air
Now make a beak
Put your left hand back
Grab one of your feet

Now hop one time! [1 musical sting]
Now hop two times! [2 musical stings]
Now hop three times! [3 musical stings]
Now hop twenty-seven times! [27 musical stings]

…Keep going… …Almost there!...

Scream! (aaah!)
Let me hear you scream! (aaah!)

Everybody vote Republican!
[For 4 measures, we hear four different fuddy-duddy
Murmuring voices saying why people should vote for
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, etc.,
Simultaneously.]

Okay, now's the time when we take everything you learned
And bring it all together. Do the Dada Slide! Are you ready? Here we go!

Earth Walk!
Right foot, left foot
Right, left, turn around!
Right foot, left foot
Right, left, turn!

Happy Cow!
Tip to the left, (Moo!)
Tip to the right, (I'm a happy cow!)
Tip to the left, (Moo!)

(Clacky clack clack!) [Clap-a-slap-clap]
(Clacky clack clack!) [Clap-a-slap-clap]
(Clacky clack clack!) [Clap-a-slap-clap]
(Clacky clack clack!) [Clap-a-slap-clap]

Hop 16 times! [16 musical stings]
…Yeah! Now you're all doing the Dada Slide!...

Everybody scream! (aaah!)
I wanna hear you scream! (aaaaah!!)
Come on and scream! (aaaaaaah!!!)
I said scream! (AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!)

[At this point we hear TV's Kyle, Insane Ian, Soggy Potato Chips
And Odd Austin begging to be released from the crazy person
Who has them held captive in a pit in the basement of his house
This lasts through the rest of the song.]

Scream all you want! There isn't a person around for miles
Ain't nobody gonna hear you. Now, it puts the lotion
On it's skin or else it gets the hose again!

Puts the lotion on it's skin
Gets the hose again
Puts the lotion on it's skin
Gets the hose again
Puts the lotion on it's skin
Gets the hose again
Puts the lotion-
Hey! Where's my dog, precious?
Hey you, leave my Precious alone!Embed"

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

[Verse 1]
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby
[Verse 2]
I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

[Chorus]
Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world

See the world we started

So the more it shines, it goes away

All the magic of the earth and the skies
See, the more we find

That every time
See the laws of nature keep telling us like a friend
Spirit of emotion dancing to the wind
High above, high above
So sure inspired again

I can tell a new story now
Can we see through this mask of uncertainty?
Surely, now
How can it be so hard when all there is to know?
Don't be afraid of letting go
It takes a loving heart
To see and show this love
For our own ecology

Things are getting kind of gross

Seems we got a cheaper feel now

Gone to the other side

She's putting on her string bean love

Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you

I wasn't looking, but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me, the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

And nobody does it better
Though sometimes, I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?

[Verse 2]
The way that you hold me whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running, but just keep it comin'
How'd you learn to do the things you do?

If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind

Ooh baby

Hey baby, oh yeah

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
But I just want to have some fun

I won't bore you with the details, baby
Gonna get there in your own sweet time

So close
In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
But I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby (Oh, yeah)
I miss my baby (tonight)
So why don't we make a little room in my BMW, babe?
Searching for some peace of mind

Am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?

And I went to a shrink
To analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
And I went to a whore
He said my life's a bore
So quit my whining 'cause it's bringing her down

All I know is making money moves man skip the hating
I done gave my own comfort up for this grind
I don't know about you,  I'm here to get mine

It's all in writing where I came from
If the name's familiar, Tema street's where my name rung
If Sark is king then I'm the heir
The silk is all rare, tailored stitching , I'm so debonair
Plotting in my lair
Poet laureate extraordinaire
Fresh fade, relax in the chair, hot towel massage, barber parted my hair
Pardon my braggadocio but I'm the man
Pull a dove out a black hat with steady hands
Bejeweled , since kindergarten I never followed no rules
I'll go dolo, no crew, heard the slick talk, it's old news
Let in dry in the old school

Keep the drinks cold
Seen shit get worse so we don't care when they reach
Before the paper meet the ink, think
Got our own weed, got our own everything
Trips every week, 20k for a seat
Tried to stay low-key but paparazzi won't let me
Old Chevies, new Mercedes, a few ladies
A couple niggas who wanted millions since we was babies
I get the room, it's so comfortable, say she gotta stay (Gotta stay)
Money, I made a lot today (A lot today)
Pulling out them private tables
Thirty a hand if you wanna play
Risk it all before I play it safe
If you broke, I'ma stay away
It goes down if I okay it
Four cars where I stay at
Racin' boats, catchin' all the wave action

The ones you named your plane after

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate

As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace

[Verse 1]
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are?
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And still, I find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But, I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I see a ship in the harbour
I can and shall obey
But, if it wasn't for your misfortune
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting

[Verse 3]
I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold?
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)

If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are

Hear the rime of the ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by a spell and the Mariner tells his tale

[Verse 2]
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow, fog flies on the Albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the Albatross follows on

[Verse 3]
The Mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

[Chorus]
Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

[Verse 4]
The Albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

[Chorus]
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

[Verse 5]
""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""

""There,"" calls the Mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""
See, onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

[Verse 7]
Death and she Life-in-Death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then, crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She, she, Life-in-Death

The curse, it lives on in their eyes

Along with the sea creatures

Sinks down like lead into the sea

Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long-dead bodies
Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat, his son, and the Hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

[Chorus]
And the ship, it sinks like lead into the sea
And the Hermit shrieves the Mariner of his sins

To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example

And never saw his father anymore
A child of sacrifice, a child of war
Another son who never
Had a father after Leningrad

And learned to serve the state
Followed the rules
And drank his vodka straight
The only way to live was drown the hate
A Russian life was very sad
And such was life in Leningrad

I was born in '49
A cold war kid in McCarthy time
Stop 'em all at the 38th Parallel
Blast those yellow reds to hell
Cold war kids were hard to kill
Under their desks in an air raid drill
Haven't they heard we won the war
What do they keep on fighting for?

Viktor was sent to some Red Army town
Served out his time
Became a circus clown
The greatest happiness he'd ever found
Was making Russian children glad
And children lived in Leningrad

Hid in the shelters underground

And tore the Cuban missiles down

I guess I was wrong, I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away, and I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the Oasis

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

The boys in the military shirts
I keep my eyes on the prize, on the long-fallen skies
And I don't let my friends get hurt
All you back room schemers, small trip dreamers
Better find something new to say
'Cause you're the same old story, it's the same old crime
And you got some heavy dues to pay

Has been shaken to the top

He went a' cruisin' down the ville
The Muezzin was a'standing
On the radiator grille

By order of the prophet
We ban that boogie sound
Degenerate the faithful
With that crazy Casbah sound
But the Bedouin they brought out
The electric kettle drum
The local guitar picker
Got his guitar pickin' thumb
As soon as the Shareef
Cleared the square
They began to wail

A choke of grief heart hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's Up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

[Refrain]
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na

You Got It (The Right Stuff) Lyrics[Intro]
The right stuff
The right stuff

[Verse 1]
First time was a great time
Second time was a blast
Third time I fell in love
Now I hope it lasts
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby
You’re the reason why I sing this song
[Pre-Chorus]
All that I needed was you
Oh girl, you're so right
Said all that I wanted was you
You made all my dreams come true

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The right stuff
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Your first kiss was a sweet kiss
Second kiss had a twist
Third and your fourth kiss
I don't want to miss
I can see it in your walk
Tell it when you talk
See it in everything you do
Even in your thoughts
You got the right stuff, baby
Love the way you turn me on
You got the right stuff, baby

But with a face like that
You got nothing to laugh about
Red lips hair and fingernails
I hear your a mean old jezabel
Lets go up stairs and read my tarot cards

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me

So in the morning
Please don't say you love me
Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door

Yea I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up

Stay with me
Stay with me
Cause tonight you better stay with me
Sit down, get up, get down

Cause tonight your going stay with me

Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

When I say goodbye it is never for long
'Cause I know our love still lives on
It will be again exactly like it was
'Cause I believe in the power of love

When it's love I can always tell
Love for me is the best thing now

Of every hour, feel the power of love, yeah
Hold me tighter and take me higher

But when your senses start to overload

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
[Chorus]
""Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969""
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 5]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

Hey, my friend
It seems your eyes are troubled
Care to share your time with me?
Would you say you're feeling low and so
A good idea would be to get it off your mind?

See, you and me
Have a better time than most can dream
Have it better than the best
So can pull on through
Whatever tears at us
Whatever holds us down
And if nothing can be done
We'll make the best of what's around

Turns out not where, but who you're with
That really matters
And hurts not much when you're around
When you're around

And if you hold on tight
To what you think is your thing
You may find you're missing all the rest
Well she ran up into the light surprised
Her arms are open

Better side than most can dream

That we could never rise above

[Verse 1]
Getting crazy on the waltzers
But it's the life that I choose
Hey, sing about the sixblade, sing about the switchback
And a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races, yeah
Just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever
Said: ""Let it rock and let it roll""
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul
[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love

[Verse 2]
It's just the danger, danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said: ""You are the perfect stranger""
She said: ""Baby, let's keep it like this""
It's just a cake walk, twisting baby, yeah, step right up and say:
""Hey Mister, give me two, give me two now, 'cos any two can play""

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

Well, it's been money for muscle on another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big

[Verse 3]
She took off a silver locket
She said: ""Remember me by this""
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay

[Chorus 1]
And the big wheel keep on turning

And I'm just high on the world

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made

Out to rockaway

Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance
[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 2]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene

[Verse 1]
They got a committee to get me off the block
'Cause I say my rhymes loud, and I say 'em nonstop
Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle, and we got thrown out
I got my boy Mike D, I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy, but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud
[Verse 2]
Slow riding, gun hidin', on the go
I'm fly like an eagle, and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef, so I gave her a smack
She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
Ay, yo, homeboy, what you drinkin', man?

[Bridge]
I got money, I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms, I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill, I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold, I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey

[Verse 3]
Because I'm hard hittin', always bitten, cool as hell
I got the trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house, gettin' high watchin' tube
I'm eating Colonel's chicken, drinkin' Heineken brew
I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster, I'm the king of the ave
I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have
All the fine ladies are making a fuss

Have you ever tried to save yourself?
A wide eyed suicide drive remains a fake
As if you'd ever, ever go and make the same mistake
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling

[Chorus]
Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones
But you don't know your time is up
Blood runs cold
[Verse 2]
Somebody somewhere is screaming out the words
Do they ever really ease the pain?
I guess what I'm trying to say is whose life is it anyway
Because living, living is the best revenge you can play
This fall from grace, I see your face it's over

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
From you love was kind
Resolved left scarred and blind
Wasted and naked in the wings
Denying twist of fate
Demanding heaven's gate
Lying in wait above the wind
Strung out as the night comes crawling
Your halo of thorns is falling

[Outro]
Blood runs cold
I feel it in my bones

Where the old world shadows hang

She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea

She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why

While the town got high

And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

Nobody caught 'em

Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl!
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time

Come on, be my girl

In the beginning, God made the land
Then he made the water and creatures, then he made man
He was born with a passion, love and hate
A restless spirit with a need for a mate
But there was something missing, something lost
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost
One part love, one part wild, one part lady, one part child

[Chorus]
I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
[Verse 2]
And in the garden, lust began
The animal instinct, the wanton man
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite
And filling with emotion he took a bite
It was one part love, one part child
One part lover, one part wild

[Chorus]
I give you (Women, women)
Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them
(Women, women) Lots of pretty women
(Men, men) They can't live without them

[Bridge]
Skin on skin
Let the love begin
Women

[Verse 3]
It was one part love, one part wild
One part lover, one part child
A whole lot of fire, a little bit of ice
A whole lot of something you can't sacrifice

What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

[Verse 3]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

Light My Fire Lyrics[Intro]
[Verse 1]
You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
[Verse 2]
The time to hesitate is through
No time to wallow in the mire
Try, now we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
Yeah

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""
Says the man next to me, out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosin' and scrubbin' as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, 'cause
[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Lettin' each one burn, down to his thick fingers
Before blowin' and cursin' them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

She had a guitar and she taught him some chords

I've been searching for an angel in white
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both
And I can feel her, but she's nowhere in sight

[Chorus]
Ooh, loneliness will blind you
In between the wrong and the right (oh, oh, oh)
Ooh, coming right behind you
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights

See what's become of me

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride than what you've got planned
Carry a cup in your hand
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hang onto your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
Grass is high
Fields are ripe
It's the springtime of my life

Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me?

Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter
Look around

There's a patch of snow on the ground

[MC Lars]
Quiet!
Martin loved Susie, they had it made
They'd been the best of friends since the second grade
They grew up and went to college different states
But promised that they'd get married if they never found mates
Well the years passed by
And what do you know?
They saw each other after college at an Atmosphere show
They dated and had fun being back together
Susie came over for Christmas and gave Martin a sweater
They decided there and then they were meant to be
So one night Martin got down on his right knee
But Susie said ""one second!"" as her cellphone rang
It was her college ex-boyfriend Philip Teng
""I want you back"" the voice with much veracity
Susie said, ""I do too!"" with much alacrity
So Martin sat dejected, rejected and alone
If only Susie had turned off her cellphone
Turn your cellphone off
Turn your cellphone off

His father Daryl Teng was afraid to fly
But he packed his bags and kissed his son goodbye
He got on the airplane at O'Hare Airport
On his way to Phoenix to testify in court
As his flight took off, he thought about his family
And his Boston cousin David who just turned 53
He took out his Blackberry, wrote a birthday email
Dangerous live drive-thru ATM braille
See, when airplanes take off, put your gadgets away
They mess up communication and lead to disarray
As the plane crashed over Wilcox, Nebraska
Daryl felt like Will Rogers leaving Barrow Alaska

It interfered with navigation without any hesitation
Causing tragic interference and general devastation
A grim situation, it all seemed very scary
This never would have happened if Phil turned off his Blackberry

Turn your Blackberry off
Turn your Blackberry off

Died in aisle four in fact
Falling right onto his back
Years of eating Twinkies had taken its toll
So God came town and claimed his Epicurean soul
His brother got his comics
His friend got his computer
The Salvation Army got his pogs and razor scooter
As for his wife Lorraine she grieved the whole year through
She found a younger lover Martin who was lonely too
The funeral was grim as they lowered David's corpse
His grade school friends showed up and gave their support
It went according to plan until the unexpected
There was a ringing from the ground the mortician had neglected
Mr. Williams was connected posthumously
To the land of electronics for all eternity
The bills could've been ridiculous
They dug up David quick
We all know he never went anywhere without his Sidekick

Till you'd someone slap your face

And you never knew how low you'd stoop
To make that call
And you never knew what was on the ground

So you never knew that the heaven

Your stick-on tattoos now they're making the news

When she pretends that we are through
So I'll just have to show her
That once I get to know her
Then we won't be one step away
And if she knew that I was hurting inside
Then soon behind my broken heart
I could no longer hide

I want to kiss her every night
But not til everything is right
She will not wait forever
She says it's now or never

One Step Away Lyrics(Raul Malo, James House)

My baby loves the things I say
She wants to hear them every day
I hope we'll be together
From now until forever
Right now we're just on step away

My baby wonders why I'm blue
When she pretends that we are through
So I'll just have to show her
That once I get to know her
Then we won't be one step away
And if she knew that I was hurting inside
Then soon behind my broken heart
I could no longer hide

I want to kiss her every night
But not til everything is right
She will not wait forever
She says it's now or never

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be
Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery

The days get rainy and the nights get long
When you get that feelin' you were born to lose
Staring at your ceiling thinkin' of your blues

When there's so much trouble that you wanna cry
The world has crumbled and you don't know why
When your hopes are fading and they can't be found
Dreams have left you waiting, friends have let you down

Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Maybe then your blues will fade away
When you need a lover and you're down so low
Start to wonder, but you never know
When it feels like sorrow is your only friend
Knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again

When the blues come callin' at the break of dawn
Rain keeps fallin', but the rainbow's gone
When you feel like crying but the tears won't come
When your dreams are dyin', when you're on the run

Just remember I love you
And it'll be alright
Just remember I love you
More than I can say
Just remember I love you

This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how—

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' it (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Verse 1]
I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night, soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
(*Whistling*)

[Verse 2]
The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers?
The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
[Chorus]
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change
Hmm

[Verse 2]
Walking down the street
And distant memories are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva and down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams (share their dreams)
With you and me (You and me)
Take me (Take me) to the magic of the moment
On a glory night (A glory night)
Where the children of tomorrow dream away (Dream away)
In the wind of change (The wind of change)

The wind of change blows straight into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring the freedom bell

It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sittin' next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin
He says, ""Son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""
[Refrain]
La, la-la, di-dee-da

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feeling alright

[Verse 2]
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be
He says, ""Bill, I believe this is killing me""
As the smile ran away from his face
""Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""
[Refrain]
Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da

[Verse 3]
Now Paul is a real estate novelist
Who never had time for a wife
And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy
And probably will be for life
And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""Man, what are you doin' here?""

Never admit to a word weh she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, ""Baby, no way!""

REMIX (Ay everybody back the fuck up)
REMIX (Back the fuck up)

(Mayhem and Conquer! Let’s go! Yee!)

Step fast
Distance don't matter
One love, 10K
[Verse 1: David Ira & Carl Angelo]
I hail from a place where the storm takes your space
Poverty stricken, leave you with hunger pangs
Spar with an oligarch in the dark, and I docked my fist in his face
'Cause my lineage told me break these chains (CHIEF)
Back when I was rappin’ with the homies, everybody always told me:
""Filipinos ain't got business in the game"" bruh
Then I put like 10k in these hours
Every beat that I devoured had me snipin' everybody in my lane bruh
(Sweeerve) What?
Whatchu got, huh? (Whatchu got)
Tell me how you movin' when the Chieftain take your spot, huh? (CHIEF)
You get dropped, huh?
Tell me what you losin' when I'm movin' to the top, huh?
My kasama got the intellect of uni-scholars
With the skin of farmers and the flow to match a unibomber
(Bitch) I was use to all the artists thinkin' we ain’t go the hardest
But proceed with caution
We’ve been known to change regimes when marchin' ’cause we (Doot doot doot doot)

[Verse 2: Nisa Longga & Carl Angelo]
Cali green flyin' high, we medicatin'
Try to bring my spirits down but I stay elevatin'
Susie Ibarra on the gongs got me meditatin’
Pull up in a rocket to the stars, I'm levitatin' (Let's go!)
I'm a goddess like my name is Gaygayoma
Bet I got you seein' stars when I put it on ya
Don't fuck with me and my crew, 'cause we'll devour you (Hrrr)
Big energy goin' pull you in like hypernova
Got presence on my shoulders feel like ten thousand pounds (Hoo)
Hearing inner voices singin' ten thousand sounds (Hoo)
Ten thousand marching every time I step foot to the ground
Its' like I'm moonwalkin' with my ten toes down
Earth, wind and fire, this ain't no fantasy
I be where the humans and the gods are
My family tree reaches up into the galaxy
Means I was born to be a mofuckin' ROCKSTAR

Step in the cypher, feel the hype from every barrio (Ay)
Not on my level climbin' up like we in Baguio (Yuh)
Adios, to all of y'all who needed bodying (Bye)
It's obvious the audience need me to rip this audio (Yeah, let's go!)

I'm packaged like balikbayan, yeah I'm well on the way (Way)
Ask me: ""pwedeng sumabay?"" but you ain't got what it takes (Sumabay!)
Everybody eats, mag kamayan off the plate

They watch, the plot thickens like some alamang paste
We up, the clocks tickin', this time we never late (Nah)

And I'm ill like Ilokanos (Ilokanos)
Blood, sweat and balisongs, built like a manong

Come walk in our shoes (10k, hrrr)
We packed up and flew (Dengue, hrrr)
That Visa on tenure (Decades, shhh)
With the Raza we rise up (Comprende)
Damn, feel like a sauna in here
You know that it's on up in here
Hot as pacific standard time south west summers in here
Shout out my kasama in here
Fuck a crab mentality, we all piranhas in here
Yeah
To sum it up we summon up shredding every living thing in the water
There's some'n in the water
Wavy as Samahang Modern
This song will echo into the plane

It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

[Verse 2]
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
[Chorus]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 3]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

When I Come Around Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I heard you crying loud
All the way across town
You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl
As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Well, don't get lonely now
And dry your whining eyes
I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get
So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around
[Verse 2]
Oh, I heard it all before
So don't knock down my door
I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser
To try and slag me down because I know you're right
So go do what you like
Make sure you do it wise
You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there
You can't go forcing something if it's just not right

[Chorus]
No time to search the world around
'Cause you know where I'll be found
When I come around

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said, nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you
[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Bus stop, wet day
She's there, I say
Please share my umbrella
Bus stops, bus goes
She stays, love grows
Under my umbrella
All that summer we enjoyed it
Wind and rain and shine
That umbrella, we employed it
By August she was mine
[Chorus]
Every morning I would see her
Waiting at the stop
Sometimes she'd shop
And she would show me what she'd bought
All the people stared
As if we were both quite insane
Someday my name and hers
Are going to be the same

[Verse 2]
That's the way the whole thing started
Silly but it's true
Thinking of our sweet romance
Beginning in a queue
Came the sun
The ice was melting
No more sheltering now
Nice to think that that umbrella
Led me to a vow

Wondering what I have could make of my life
And who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening

There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

Ooh, you must believe me

But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going, but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all

I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you

That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singin', come away
(Come away)
(Come away)

[Chorus]
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singin'
Said, whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo

[Bridge]
Well, I hear you (Well, I hear you)
In the morning (In the morning)
And I hear you (And I hear you)
At nightfall (At nightfall)
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to hear you
My love
I'm a few years older than you, my love
(I'm a few years older than you)

[Chorus]
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
(Just like the white winged dove)
Sounds like she's singin'
Whoo, baby, whoo
Said, whoo
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song

If I see the morning hours
I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
Because I've burned out my today
If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
I've got a terminal future
And it's time to write my will

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I downed another glass of courage
And a shot of Thorazine
[Chorus]
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

[Verse 2]
Got a short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave
I've got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In a black tie and straightjacket
Man, I'm going to try again

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays, they only die
There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same

Say we'll be together every day

Out in the court-yard they're ready for me
But I go to my Lord with no fear
'Cause I did what I did for Maria

[Verse 2]
As I rode into town with the sun going down
All the windows were barred there was no-one around
For they knew that I'd come with my hand on my gun
And revenge in my heart for Maria

Take an eye for an eye and a life for a life
And somebody must die for the death of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria

There was the man I was burnin' to meet
And my mind was so calm and so clear
As I took my revenge for Maria

[Verse 4]
And he fell to the ground raisin' dust all around
But I knew he was dead long before he went down
It was quick it was clean made it easy on him

The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

[Verse 2]
I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care
[Verse 3]
My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea

This place has changed for good
Your economic theory said it would
It's hard for us to understand
We can't give up our jobs the way we should

[Verse 2]
Our blood has stained the coal
We tunneled deep inside the nation's soul
We matter more than pounds and pence
Your economic theory makes no sense
[Chorus]
One day in a nuclear age
They may understand our rage
They build machines that they can't control
And bury the waste in a great big hole
Power was to become cheap and clean
Grimy faces were never seen
But deadly for twelve thousand years
Is carbon fourteen
We work the black seam together
We work the black seam together

[Verse 3]
The seam lies underground
Three million years of pressure packed it down
We walk through ancient forest lands
And light a thousand cities with our hands

[Verse 4]
Your dark satanic mills
Have made redundant all our mining skills
You can't exchange a six inch band
For all the poisoned streams in Cumberland

[Chorus]
One day in a nuclear age
They may understand our rage
They build machines that they can't control
And bury the waste in a great big hole
Power was to become cheap and clean
Grimy faces were never seen
But deadly for twelve thousand years
Is carbon fourteen

We Work the Black Seam Lyrics[Verse 1]
This place has changed for good
Your economic theory said it would
It's hard for us to understand
We can't give up our jobs the way we should

[Verse 2]
Our blood has stained the coal
We tunneled deep inside the nation's soul
We matter more than pounds and pence
Your economic theory makes no sense
[Chorus]
One day in a nuclear age
They may understand our rage
They build machines that they can't control
And bury the waste in a great big hole
Power was to become cheap and clean
Grimy faces were never seen
But deadly for twelve thousand years
Is carbon fourteen
We work the black seam together
We work the black seam together

[Verse 3]
The seam lies underground
Three million years of pressure packed it down
We walk through ancient forest lands
And light a thousand cities with our hands

[Verse 4]
Your dark satanic mills
Have made redundant all our mining skills
You can't exchange a six inch band
For all the poisoned streams in Cumberland

[Chorus]
One day in a nuclear age
They may understand our rage
They build machines that they can't control
And bury the waste in a great big hole
Power was to become cheap and clean
Grimy faces were never seen
But deadly for twelve thousand years
Is carbon fourteen

[Verse 5]
And should the children weep
The turning world will sing their souls to sleep
When you have sunk without a trace
The universe will suck me into place

[Chorus]
One day in a nuclear age
They may understand our rage
They build machines that they can't control

Well, I woke up this morning, stumbled out of my rack
I opened up the paper to the page in the back
It only took a minute for my finger to find
My daily dose of destiny under my sign
My eyes just about popped out of my head
It said, ""The stars are stacked against you girl, get back in bed""

[Chorus]
I feel lucky
I feel lucky, yeah
No Professor Doom going to stand in my way
Mmm, I feel lucky today
[Verse 2]
Well, I strolled down to the corner, gave my numbers to the clerk
The pot's eleven million so I called in sick to work
I bought a pack of Camels, a burrito, and a Barq's
Crossed against the light, made a beeline for the park
The sky began to thunder, wind began to moan
I heard a voice above me saying, ""Girl, you better get back home""

[Chorus]
But I feel lucky
Oh, oh, oh, I feel lucky, yeah
No tropical depression gonna steal my sun away
Mmm, I feel lucky today

[Verse 3]
Now eleven million later I was sitting at the bar
I'd bought the house a double and the waitress a new car
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovett's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story, it's simple but it's true:
Hey the stars might lie but the numbers never do

Oh, oh, oh
I feel lucky, yeah
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight

Well UK culture like
Usually is, very centered towards, um, London
Like that's where like UK culture presumably is
From the outside world like people who are not in the UK
But really in UK, Birmingham like they got they own culture
Manchester's got they own culture
Like Nottingham got its own culture
And even Liverpool got they own culture
And obviously Northampton as well
And the maddest thing about all those places
Is like, there's one thing that they all have in common
And thats that there's a bottom of the pile
And the bottom of the pile is real gritty, you hear me?
Doesn't matter where you comin' from cos
All around the world there's a ghetto
All around the world there's a slum
All around the world there's a hood, somewhere
All around the world there's always a bottom
[Pre-Verse]
Grease
Vybz Kartel man are bleached
Come through the fog like steez
Upon horseback manna breeze
Water it down like Evian
Think that Tyron's naive
Pitchforks and keys
Telling me farmers ain't got dreams? (farmers are coming)

[Verse 1]
Tyron's too crooked
Tackle the scene two footed
Pose for a scene but factually speaking
Them man are leeches
Them man are just pussies
Trap for a weekend when they ain't eating
Run to their Mummys
Northants ain't got the twang like Brummys
More time I can’t confined
Cause problems
No father figure, but my mum was watching
Bamboo, grew up too fast, no confidence
Butterfly stomach, didn’t have no options
Drugs or a job and the job got lost quick
Ignorant obvious, mans obnoxious
Voice in my head:
“Don’t go to the doctor's
Go to the pub
Brandy and a Fosters”

There's a bottom of the pile
And the bottom of the pile is real gritty, you hear me?
The majority are at the bottom
That's the realest thing
So it's like, doesn't matter where you comin' from cos
All around the world there's a ghetto
All around the world there's a slum
All around the world there's a hood somewhere
All around the world there's always the bottom

[Verse 2]
Electric gone, that’s calm though
Heart's too black like charcoal
Man have been moving cargo
End this scene like Fargo
Take off your chin like Bravo
Man shout gang like Kartel
Then get prang like heart felt
Then run off like ""Ahh well""
Get beat up then they all talk
Fist fighting well it’s just sport
Wait till the ball's in my court my brudda
I just want a house and a Porsche for my mudda
Gates to the grounds, fountain with a giraffe
Black diamonds, granite floor for the car park
Buttler’s, milk and a Mars bar
First class well, thai's class harder
Jealousy doing better then my father
What ya saying, what you're saying means nada
Circumstances I know my actions
I’ve been attracted, chasing mansions
Charlie Manson, voice of a leader
You hate life, I don’t like it either
Sit in the pub Like a geezer
I can’t smile like Lisa
Can’t remember, don’t smoke Amnesia
Every day I put more money in the metre
Gassed everyday I put more in than a litre
Mad what we’ll pay, no space for a breather
419 transfers with Enoch
Workouts, yeah I had scuffs on my Reeboks
Pick my feet up, used to get beat up
Now I walk in your yard, kick my feet up
Put T in a teacup
I’m not a mug you can dip Rich Tea on
Speak when spoken mum said be gone
Wanna be bigger than The Beatles
Look through the key hole for that kilo
I ain't got kids I gotta feed though
I’m just a monkey sitting in a tree bro
Spend a monkey, monkey not me though
Said I’m gassed up like Steve-O
We clash, villain and a hero
Sometimes I can’t look past my ego
Tell me what I need cause I need yours
Tell me what you see cause I see flaws
Tell me what to eat cause I eat yours
Tell me how to be me more
Like gorge, cause I’m so gorgeous
Bored boredom, getting Moreish
Toothache I’ll take it out
I don’t go to the dentist
Cause I’m poor blood
[Outro - Kwes Darko]
Doesn't matter where you're comin' from
Right that culture, there's gonna be a twist in that culture
There's gonna be a difference and then be a different personality from that comes from that culture
And Thai's personality comes from the grittiness of Northamphton
How he grew up, where he grew up

Yeee-hey, yeah
Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah
[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Nah don' rush me good, and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find
[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man

We come together 'cause opposites attract
And you know it ain't fiction, just a natural fact

She's got the money and he's always broke
I don't like cigarettes and I like to smoke
Things in common? There just ain't a one!
But when we get together, we have nothin' but fun

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

""Welcome to the Hotel California

She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard

Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""

And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

And I guess it was enough for me

Think I'm gonna get me some happy

I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from fallin'
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meanin' when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me, yeah
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me

[Verse 3: Elton John, George Michael, & both]
I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (Baby, no)
Just because you think I mean you harm

They need love (They need love, they need love)

Sittin' in a nest of bad men
Whiskey bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the DA man
When I heard this woman sing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just-a 5'9, beautiful, tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'Cause that long cool woman had it all

I saw her heading to the table
Like a tall walking big black cat
When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy
Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Then suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A-jumping out of doors and tables
When I heard somebody shootin' a gun

Well the DA was pumping my left hand
And a-she was a-holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared

Well I told her don't get scared
'Cause you're gonna be spared
I've gotta be forgiven if I wanna spend my living

Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Yeah, with just one look I was a bad mess

She used to walk by my side
But when we got to her doorstep
Her dad wouldn't let me inside

One Monday morning
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking
Had she done the same?

La la, la-la la la la

One Monday morning
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking

I hope Jennifer Eccles
Is going to follow me there
Our love is bound to continue
Love, kiss, hate, or adore

I know that she loves me

Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?

Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

Why a was born in to this world of fear

To find out who am I
But all I found was just confusion
Never got what I wanted
Only peaces of a broken heart
In the miles I seek belief
In the wind I seek the blame
For all the dreams are just a trace in eternity
And as the lonely nights have past
Wondering why
Come and heal my bleeding soul
Come and still my bleeding heart

I woke up in a dream, Wyclef and Ivy Queen
Drinkin with your Hennessey, you spit on Louis the XIII
I ain't tipsy but C-O-P stopped me
Cause I'm with Omar, a Puerto Rican with a Lamborghini
Ole, ole but this ain't a bullfight
Late at night, I'm gonna bring the fright of Poltergeist
Looked at me through the shades
Tried to play me like a hermit
I looked at Omar and said, ""Yo pass me my gun permit""

[Ivy Queen]
I went to the place donde acordamos en el ghetto
Man, tu me dijiste que llegarías primero
Pasa el tiempo y yo no creo que tu vayas a llegar, 'Clef
Monto en mi carro y recojo el celular
Que es lo que puede pasar
Te tengo que llamar
Para saber porque rayos no estas en ese lugar
[?] telling me you was gone
I'ma call the Navy Seal buscando al refugiador

He looked at my permit and said, ""Get out the car""
I'm about to bring the earth, wind, and fire like a Shining Star
Looked at him bizarre, I said, ""Hell no""
The music got tense in a place called el barrio

[Ivy Queen]
En el carnaval del barrio
Entre latinos y boricuas buscando
Anything can happen, algo sin esperarlo
Wyclef and Ivy Queen, el duo aclamado

[Wyclef]
Ivy Queen, there was no one around the street
Was like ghost town
Six cop cars, one black, one Porto Rican
I ain't a shook one, so I got out the car
I close my eyes, son, I'm waitin for police to blast one

[Ivy Queen]
Yo vengo en mi Beamer oyendo salsa, mis raíces son primero
Llamo a Nelson, le pregunto si no ha visto al Refugiado
Man y al Gran Omar que con Wyclef se ha perdido
Y será esta vez posible que cantemos hoy unidos
Well, para sorpresa de la Queen
Y ahí veo a Wyclef de lejos que lo estaban deteniendo (Latino)

Bien por su music, su color o será por su aspecto

And take him shoppin to the Bahamas, and hide with mobsters

I had no reason to be carefree - no, no, no
'Til I took a trip to the other side of town - yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I heard that boogie rhythm
Hey! I had no choice but to get down, down, down, down

Dance!
Nothing left for me to do but dance
Off these bad times I'm going through, just dance
Got canned heat in my heels, tonight, baby

[Verse 2]
I feel the thunder, see the lightning
I know this anger's Heaven-sent
So I've got to hang out all my hang-ups
'Cause of the boogie, I feel so Hell-bent, hey, hey
It's just an instant gut reaction, that I got
I know I've never, ever felt like this before
I don't know what to do
But then that's nothing new
Stuck between Hell and high water, need a cure to make it through, hey!

Seven Wonders Lyrics[Verse 1]
So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but
[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

[Post-Chorus]
The rainbow's edge

(Aaron)

[Verse 2]
So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

[Chorus]
If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end

Which is the way he wants it

*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you mean

Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
You're power-hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war

Look at the lies we've swallowed

[Verse 3]
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
And all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you mean

[Bridge]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

But it's them they know, not me
Now there's a way

There's a mountain, and it's mighty high
You cannot see the top, unless you fly
And there's a molehill of proven ground
There ain't no where to go if you hang around

[Chorus: Prince]
Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire, there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold
[Verse 2: Prince]
There's an ocean of despair
There are people livin' there
They're unhappy each and every day
But hell is not fashion so whatcha tryin' to say?

[Chorus: Prince]
Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold

All that glitters ain't gold, no no

[Verse 3: Prince]
There's a lady, 99 years old
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul
Now that's a theory, and if you don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way for those who want to go

[Chorus: Prince]
Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold (Sold)
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told (Told)
What's the use of bein' young if you ain't gonna get old? (Old)

Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus 1]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?

I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

[Chorus]
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me
[Verse 2]
I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

[Post-Chorus]
The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

[Bridge]
If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

Nothing can come between us

Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)

Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again (Tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic, tchic)

Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern
As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can
[Pre-Chorus]
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns

[Chorus]
He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (All alone)
All alone in her time of need
Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance

[Post-Chorus]
Yah!

[Verse 2]
No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force
In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade
She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse

Walking through forests of palm tree apartments
Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday
Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows

[Chorus]
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yeah
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree
[Verse 2]
Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, and thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner

Scoff at the monkeys who live in their dark tents
Down by the waterhole, drunk every Friday
Eating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday
Lions and tigers who wait in the shadows
They're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows

[Chorus]
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yeah
Well, I'm a tiger when I want love
But I'm a snake if we disagree
[Verse 2]
Just say a word and the boys will be right there
With claws at your back to send a chill through the night air
Is it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?
Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder
I'll write on your tombstone, and thank you for dinner
This game that we animals play is a winner

[Chorus]
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
I'm a snake if we disagree, yes
{Bridge}

[Verse 3]
The rivers are full of crocodile nasties
And he who made kittens put snakes in the grass
He's a lover of life but a player of pawns
Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn
To light up His Jungle as play is resumed
The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune

[Chorus]
Well, let's bungle in the jungle
Well, that's all right by me, yes
I'm a tiger when I want love
And I'm a snake when we disagree, yes

Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town

[Bridge 1]
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay

Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way 'cross town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do
Is fall in love
[Verse 2]
Arthur, he does as he pleases
All of his life, his master's toys
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a pretty good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster
As I step out on my own
There's a new horizon
And the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight
Traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again
[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Verse 2]
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings
And tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting
Down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

Sledgehammer Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, hey, you
Tell me how have you been?

[Verse 1]
You could have a steam train
If you just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need
[Verse 2]
You could have a big dipper
Going up and down, all around the bends
You could have a bumper car, bumping
This amusement never ends

[Chorus]
I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
Oh, let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony

[Verse 3]
Show me 'round your fruit cage
'Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruit cage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be

[Chorus]
I wanna be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name?
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it

Don't cut out my paper heart
I ain't dying anyway
Take a look at Eiffel towers
Never trust them dirty liars
Sipping lemon yellow booze

All dressed up on wedding day

But I'm not dead and I'm not for sale
So keep your bankroll lottery
Eat your salad day, deathbed motorcade

Fake the heat and scratch the itch
Skinned up knees and salty lips
I'll breathe your life, Vicks vapor life
And when you binge, I purge alike, let go
It's harder holding on
One more trip and I'll be gone
So keep your head up, keep it on
Just a whisper, I'll be gone
Take a breath and make it big
It's the last you'll ever get
Break your neck with diamond noose
It's the last you'll ever choose

Little Things Lyrics[Verse 1]
I bleach the sky every night
Loaded on wrong and further from right
Spinning around, two howling moons
'Cause they're always there, whatever I do

[Verse 2]
The river is loaded, I've been there today
Took it some questions, she does me again
I'd die in your arms if you were dead too
Here comes a lie, we will always be true
[Pre-Chorus]
Going up when coming down
Scratch away

[Chorus]
It's the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
The little things that kill
It's the little things that kill
Tearing at my brains again
The little things that kill

[Verse 3]
Bigger you give, gigger you get
We're boss at denial but best at forget
Cupboard is empty, we really need food
Summer is winter and you always knew

Well, I think that there's a problem here
Her voice just don't sound right
But I left myself on her answering machine
Said, ""I'm back in town tonight""

I feel I've stepped out of the wilderness
All squint eyed and confused
But even babies raised by wolves
They know exactly when they've been used

See, when it starts to fall apart
Man, it really falls apart
Like boots or hearts, oh, when they start
They really fall apart

Forty things we share
Forty one if you include
The fact that we don't care

Now you've blocked off most of Main Street
For your faith parade
Well, everyone in town now, they probably all agree

This Magic Moment Lyrics[Verse 1]
This magic moment
So different and so new
Was like any other
Until I kissed you

And then it happened
It took me by surprise
I knew that you felt it too
By the look in your eyes
[Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Verse 2]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

[Bridge]
Oh (magic)
Oh (magic)
Mmm (magic)

[Chorus]
Sweeter than wine
Softer than the summer night
Everything I want I have
Whenever I hold you tight

[Verse 2]
This magic moment
While your lips are close to mine
Will last forever
Forever till the end of time

Or troubled by some foolish game

Quite a long, long time and I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
And to silently remind me
Of the happiness and good times that I know

[Verse 2]
Just got to know them, it isn't what she's got to say
Or how she thinks and where she's been
To me the words are nice the way they sound

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play

Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border

The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

I'll get you back, motherfuck, I'm no baby, I'm no baby
I've made a meal; the first course is crow
Choke it down cause you suck, I'm no baby, I'm no baby

You never said smart was your strong trait
Smart never seemed to be a trait at all
And I never wanted to see you go down
But I must admit that I'd like to see you
[Verse 2]
Fall right back into your tar trap
And bend your back until it fucking snaps
And I never wanted to hurt you that bad
But I must admit that I'd like to see you fall

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams
[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though ""Our health"" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think, ""We gots to part""
Gotta keep on searching for my baby

Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Save Me Lyrics[Chorus]
Save me
Take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
Save me
Take me away from the action
For you are the only attraction
Take me away from here

[Verse 1]
The party's on and one by one
The cars arrive and the people come
And I wonder if there will be anybody here alone
Another married guy tries to catch my eye
Should I smile or should I sigh?
Then you walked through the door and I saw
That you were all on your own
[Chorus]
Save me
Take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
Come on and save me
Let's get away from the action
For you are the only attraction
Take me away from here

[Verse 2]
We slipped away without a single word
No-one saw and no-one heard
'Cause we both agreed that I just wasn't worth it to stay
I went cold and hot, should I go or not?
You grabbed my hand and I couldn't stop
And I laughed and you smiled as we left and drove away

[Chorus]
Save me
Take me away to the moonlight
The people around me don't feel right
What are we doing here?
Come on and save me
Let's get away from the action
For you are the only attraction
Take me away from here

This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me
[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time

Girls!
All I really want is (Girls!)
And in the morning it’s (Girls!)
‘Cause in the evening it’s (Girls!)

[Verse 1]
I like the way that they walk
And it's chill to hear them talk
And I can always make 'em smile
From White Castle to the Nile
[Verse 2]
Back in the day (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
There was this girl around the way (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
She liked my home-piece MCA (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
He said he would not give her play (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I asked him ""Please?"", he said ""You may"" (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
Her pants were tight, and that's ok (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
If she would dance, I would DJ (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
We took a walk down to the bay

[Verse 3]
I hope she'll say (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
""Hey, me and you should hit the hay!"" (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I asked her out, she said ""No way!""(bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I should've probably guessed her gay (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
So I broke north with no delay (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I heard she moved real far away (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
That was two years ago this May (bom, bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom, bom, bom-bom)
I seen her just the other day

Where they never close downtown

The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

Waiting for you tonight, downtown

When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown

Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?

[Verse 2]
And people came from miles around, everyone was there
Yoko brought her walrus, there was magic in the air
An' over in the corner, much to my surprise
Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes wearing his disguise
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came
No one heard the music, we didn't look the same
I said, hello to ""Mary Lou"", she belongs to me
When I sang a song about a honky-tonk, it was time to leave

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Someone opened up a closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode
Playing guitar like a-ringin' a bell and lookin' like he should
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all I sang, I rather drive a truck

I can't feel all the pressure, and I like it this way
But my body's calling, my body's calling:
""Won't you come back to this world again?""
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end, I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily, my friends are calling back to me
I said, they're, they're leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin' on
Goddamn it

You live your life like it's a coma, won't you tell me why we'd wanna?
With all the reasons you give, it's, it's kinda hard to believe
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason why you should stay?
Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway
You got a one-way ticket, on your last chance ride
Got a one-way ticket to your suicide
Got a one-way ticket, and there's no way out alive
An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
But if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told
No, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul
Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line
But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside
They be down by the water while you watch 'em waving goodbye
They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone
They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home
When the bell's stopped ringing it was nobody's fault, but your own
There were always ample warnings, there were always subtle signs
And you would have seen it comin' but we gave you too much time
And when you said that no one's listening, why'd your best friend drop a dime?
Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time
An' it's so easy to be social, it's so easy to be cool
Yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose
And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
But I'm still out here, waiting, watching reruns of my life

Coma Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, you caught me in a coma and I don't think I wanna
Ever come back to this world again
Kinda like it in a coma 'cause no one's ever gonna
Oh, make me come back to this world again
Now, I feel as if I'm floating away
I can't feel all the pressure, and I like it this way
But my body's calling, my body's calling:
""Won't you come back to this world again?""
Suspended deep in a sea of black
I've got the light at the end, I've got the bones on the mast
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing
I could leave so easily, my friends are calling back to me
I said, they're, they're leavin' it all up to me
When all I needed was clarity, and
Someone to tell me what the fuck is goin' on
Goddamn it
[Bridge]
Slipping farther and farther away
It's a miracle how long we can stay
In a world our minds created
In a world that's full of shit

From some ancient fight
About the size of a fist
Or something thrown that had missed
And there were other holes as well
In the house where our nights fell

Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger

You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fucking useless

Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long

[Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
I remember shots without a chaser
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars, put on your game face
Left you in the bar to try and save face

Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down

Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode

But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made

Oh my, but that little country boy could play

On candy-stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light

Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)

[Refrain]
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

[Verse 2]

Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah, but sooner or later, you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's okay, you wake up with yourself

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

My Life Lyrics[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Got a call from an old friend, we used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

[Chorus]
I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone
[Post-Chorus]
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
(I never said you had to...)
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
(I never said...)

[Refrain]
I still belong (Still belong)
Don't get me wrong (Get me wrong)
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

[Verse 2]

Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else

It's been seven hours and thirteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing
[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?
I could put my arms around every girl I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me
Guess what he told me
He said, ""Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do""
But he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
No, nothing compares to you
Nothing, nothing

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the backyard
All died when you went away

Cold as Ice Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Some day, you'll pay the price
I know

[Chorus]
I've seen it before, it happens all the time (Ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (Ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But some day, you'll pay the price

She came from Providence
One in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea

[Verse 2]
She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide
[Verse 3]
Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high

[Verse 4]
And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

[Verse 5]
Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And, Jesus, people bought 'em
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun
Sinking in the sea

You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did
So many years ago
They even brought a neon sign
""Jesus is coming""
They brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign

[Verse 7]
Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier
But we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs
And justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God

And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
And stand up and sing about
What it's like up there

And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the Metro

Smiling as you took my hand
So removed
We spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed, and still I hurt
Oh, I can see you now
Smiling as I pulled away

""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes

The kind of a man the West would need
To tame a troubled land

Stay on when he should go, stay on
Just trying to build a peaceful life
Where love is free to grow

But the point of a gun
Was the only law that Liberty understood
When the final showdown came to pass

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, ah, that night
When nothing she said could keep

[Ray:] First like a jerk, why you always work?
Messing up your mind with that paperwork?
The only think you need is to break ball is work, and yo, and that's all
They do it for money, but he for fun
He won't get away until the job is done
Drinkin' drinkin' like an alchoholic
The guy is just a workaholic!

Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind
Dead kings, many things I can't define
Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind
Incense and peppermints, the color of time

Who cares what games we choose?
Little to win, but nothin' to lose

To divide the cockeyed world in two
Throw your pride to one side, it's the least you can do

I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall?
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and I played that fool for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried, there were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong
This ain't a love song

[Verse 2]
Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong?
[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
After having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

But happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was never-ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?

[Bridge: Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson]
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray, it might come true
Oh, baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (Oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (And then we'd be happy)

Yeah-yeah!

[Verse 1]
Well, I woke up this morning on the wrong side of the bed
And how I got to thinkin' about all those things you said
About ordinary people and how they make you sick
And if callin' names kicks back on you, then I hope this does the trick
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm sick of your complainin' about how many bills
And I'm sick of all your bitchin' 'bout your poodles and your pills
And I just can't see no humor about your way of life
And I think I can do more for you with this here fork and knife!

[Chorus]
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're very good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh huh!

[Verse 2]
So I called up my head shrinker, and I told him what I'd done
He said ""You'd best go on a diet, yeah I hope you have some fun
And-a don't go burst a bubble on the rich folks who get rude
'Cause you won't get in no trouble when you eats that kinda food""

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now they're smokin' up the junk bonds, and then they go get stiff
And they're dancin' in the yacht club with Muff and Uncle Biff
But there's one good thing that happens when you toss your pearls to swine
Their attitudes may taste like shit, but go real good with wine!

[Chorus]
Eat the rich; there's only one thing they're good for
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, come back for more
Eat the rich; I gotta get this off my chest
Eat the rich; I take one bite now, spit out the rest, uh!

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
[Chorus]
Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know

To be a rock and not to roll

But it was definitely a little misty on
(But it was definitely)
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding
(Pounding)
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face
To feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you
To taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need (and every time)
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time (back in time)
(I go back, I go back, I go back)
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
And so we finished the Moët and
I started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
(You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet (so I)
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time
(And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot
The sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood

I was walkin' down the street
Concentrating on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces, one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other

[Chorus: Graham Gouldman & Eric Stewart]
I say
I don't like cricket, oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket, no no
I love it
Don't you walk through my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet
[Verse 2: Graham Gouldman]
Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be joking man
It was a present from me mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home

[Chorus: Graham Gouldman & Eric Stewart]
And I say
I don't like reggae, no no
I love it

Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer me pitch
Don't you walk through my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet

[Verse 3: Graham Gouldman]
I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' piña colada
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder?
She said I've got it, you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it, you'll like it
And wallow in a dreadlock holiday

You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom “Please?”, but she still says “No”
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

[Chorus]
You gotta fight for your right to party

That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted)

You gotta fight

Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear

She's a river and she's turning there in front of me
Stand back - get back
She'll paint your blue skies black
She gives bullet proof protection
Got a resurrection feel
When I'm scared, and 'bout to lose
She gives me travelling shoes

Wasting my time
While the rivers in front of me
That's where I'm goin' to be
Shine on, get on
Twilight from dusk to dawn
She's the spirit of creation
She's the last chance guarantee
Got a myriad of poses
Sweet miracles and roses
She's a river and she's turning in front of me

'Cause when I find

The river's in front of me

They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms
So take me on that freedom ride
My heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon

Meet me on the staircase
Outside a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame

All things must pass
And nothing can remain

Drive a big expensive car
I would buy you everything
Your little heart desires
These things I do
‘Cause I'm stone in love with you
(Stone in love with you)

If I were a business man
I'd sit behind a desk
I'd be so successful
I would scare Wall Street to death

I'm just a man, an average man
Doing everything the best I can
But if I could
I'd give the world to you

I'd like to someday be the owner of
The first house on the moon.
There would be no neighbors
And no population boom

Jumped in a limousine ready to wipe out

Don't grumble, give a whistle
And this'll help things turn out for the best

Snow can wait, I forgot my mittens
Wipe my nose, get my new boots on
I get a little warm in my heart when I think of winter
I put my hand in my father's glove
I run off where the drifts get deeper
Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
I hear a voice: ""You must learn to stand up
For yourself, cause I can't always be around""

[Chorus]
He says:
""When you gonna make up your mind?
When you gonna love you as much as I do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
'Cause things are gonna change so fast
All the white horses are still in bed
I tell you that I'll always want you near
You say that things change, my dear""
[Verse 2]
Boys get discovered as winter melts
Flowers competing for the sun
Years go by and I'm here still waiting
Withering where some snowman was
Mirror mirror, where's the crystal palace?
But I only can see myself
Skating around the truth who I am
But I know that the ice is getting thin

I wake up in the morning and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow, and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm goin', only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run, a six gun lover, a candle in the wind

[Verse 2]
When you're brought into this world, they say you're born in sin
Well, at least they gave me somethin', I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well, they tell me that I'm wanted, yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable, I'm what Cain was to Abel, Mr. Catch-Me-If-You-Can
[Chorus]
I'm goin' down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
And, Lord, I never drew first, but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son, call me young gun

[Verse 3]
You ask about my conscience and I offer you my soul
You ask If I'll grow to be a wise man, well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come, I've seen it shot down, I've seen it die in vain

[Chorus]
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm goin' out in a blaze of glory
Lord, I never drew first but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son, call me young gun

Each night I go to bed, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No, I ain't lookin' for forgiveness, but before I'm six foot deep

And they don't want to cause any harm
But if you don't like what they're going to do
You better not stop them, 'cause they're coming through

They're justified and they're ancient
And they know what time is love
They're justified and they're ancient
Did they come from up above?
Rock Man, he's just made of bricks
And King Boy lost his screws
Their jams don't need no master plan
To do whatever, ever they can

I am born
I am me
I am new
I am free
Look at me
I am young
Sight unseen
Life unsung...
[Verse 2]
My eyes have just been opened
And they're open very wide
Images around me
Don't identify inside
Just one blur I recognize
The one that soothes and feeds
My way of life is easy
And as simple are my needs

[Chorus]
'Yet my eyes are drawn toward
The mountain in the east
Fascinates and captivates
Gives my heart no peace
The mountain holds the sunrise
In the prison of the night
Until bursting forth from rocky chains
The valley floods with light'

[Verse 2]
Living one long sunrise
For to me all things are new
I've never watched the sky grow pale
Or strolled through fields of dew
I do not know of dust to dust
I live from breath to breath
I live to climb that mountain
To the Fountain of Lamneth

[Verse 4]
Crying back to consciousness
The coldness grips my skin
The sky is pitching violently
Drawn by shrieking winds
Seaspray blurs my vision
Waves roll by so fast
Save my ship of freedom
I'm lashed helpless to the mast

[Verse 5]
Remembering when first I held
The wheel in my own hands
I took the helm so eagerly
And sailed for distant lands
But now the sea's too heavy
And I just... I just don't understand
Why must my crew desert me?
When I need... I need a guiding hand

[Bridge]
Call out for direction
And there's no one there to steer
Shout out for salvation
But there's no one there to hear
Cry out supplication
For the maelstrom is near
Scream out desperation
But no one cares to hear

Is unfolding from my mind

Have I left my life behind?

I catch the scent of ambergris
And turn my head, surprised
My gaze is caught and held
And I am helpless, mesmerized

[Chorus]
'Panacea ~ liquid grace
Oh let me touch your fragile face
Enchantment falls around me
And I know I cannot leave'

[Verse 7]
Here's a meaning for my life
A shelter from the storm
Pacify my troubles with
Her body, soft and warm
Naked in our unity
A smile for every tear
Gentle hands that promise me
Comfort through the years

[Pre-Chorus]
Yet I know I must be gone
Before the light of dawn

My heart will lie beside you
And my wandering body grieves'

Another glass of wine

Long night's time out of mind

'Draw another goblet
From the cask of '43
Crimson misty memory
Hazy glimpse of me
Give me back my wonder
~ I've something more to give
I guess it doesn't matter
~ There's not much more to
Not much more to live'

[Verse 9]
Another foggy dawn
The mountain almost gone
Another doubtful fear
The road is not so clear
My soul grows ever weary...
And the end is ever near

'Now, at last I fall before
The Fountain of Lamneth
I thought I would be singing
But I'm tired... out of breath
Many journeys end here
But, the secret's told the same
Life is just a candle and a dream
Must give it flame'

[Verse 11]
The key, the end, the answer
Stripped of their disguise
Still it's all confusion
And tears spring to my eyes
Though I've reached a signpost
It's really not the end

And I ain't got nothing to say

I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there, baby

I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know that there is

There's a joke here somewhere, and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say, ""You gotta stay hungry""
Hey, baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I need a love reaction
